React front end that allows you to add, edit and delete data which is preserved
between browser sessions. Once I get this down I want to try incorporating it
into my fitness tracker app which at the moment just reads static data from a const
variable.

Starting with a button that logs the datetime in a txt file when clicked.

Ended up just playing with requesting and responding with JSON here. User can register
details which are stored in a users.json folder, then can try logging in where
username and password are matched with existing user in the 'database'
